# Basics
#########
- test fixture = fixed data and fixed environment so that test runs and results are repeatable
- input data, mock objects, loading database with known data, etc

- unit testing = ideally 70-80% converage
- no external dependencies, no database, no spring context, etc

- integration tests = between objects and overall system
- can include spring context, database and message brokers, etc

- functional tests = testing the running application which is live and deployed
- testing functionality like using a web driver, calling web services, sending/receiving messages, etc

- unit tests => integration tests => functional tests

- tdd = unit tests first -> fix -> refactor
- bdd = given -> when -> then

- mocks = fake implementation of a class
- test double for dependent objects - expected - verify

- spy = like a mock but real object
